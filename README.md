# CJSON - A JSON parser for C/C++
\* Still under development

## Building
***
Building with `make run` will create a `build/` directory and the compiled executable can be found at 
`build/cjson`. The .o files will be under `build/obj/src/`. When building, be sure to maintain the `main.c` file.

## Usage
***
Build an archive file under `build/dist/cjson.a` with `make build`. When compiling, link the .a file along with your project files.
